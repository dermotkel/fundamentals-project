project for the fundamentals of data analysis project - 2018

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the project for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module. It is divided into eight sections including an introduction and conclusion:

- **Detective and prosecutor** : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is introduced with the detective and prosecutor analogy
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** : Key characteristics of EDA: Data visualisation, iterative process and robust statistics.
- **Five Number Summary** : Tuckey's quantitative summary is introduced.
- **Boxplots** : Boxplots are created demonstrating their usefull in analysing data
- **Limitations** : Limitations are discussed, particularly a sensitivity to outliers.
- **Violinplots** : An alternative to boxplots is examined.

I would suggest that you run the notebook from top to bottom in order. If you encounter any problems:

Run the cell immediately above - there may be a return needed from here to run your current cell.
If that fails, go back to the top of the notebook and run the cell which imports numpy and the other required packages.
Finally, you may have to close the notebook, kill jupyter notebook on the command line and restart it.
